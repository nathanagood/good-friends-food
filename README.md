# My Recipes

This is a collection of my favorite recipes that I'm gathering over time.

I have the recipes split into what you might cook them in or on, such as
the Instant Pot, sous vide, grill, etc. Then I organize the recipe by 
main protein, such as "chicken", "beef", "pork".

I'll build a table of contents here as it makes sense.
