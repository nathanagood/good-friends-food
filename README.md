# Good Friends and Food

This is a collection of favorite recipes gathered over time.

The recipes are split into what you might cook them in or on, such as
the Instant Pot, sous vide, grill, etc. Then organized the recipe by 
main protein, such as "chicken", "beef", "pork".

I'll build a table of contents here as it makes sense.
